    This middleware should be placed at the very top of the middleware stack.

    various ways which is better than corrupting or revealing data...

    If the request comes from a subdomain (a schema that isn't public), a token is added to the request URL
    path to force django to route this to schema-dependent views. This allows different views at the same URL.

    This schema-token is removed automatically when calling the schemata url tag or the reverse function.
